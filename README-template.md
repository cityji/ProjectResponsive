### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 3 custom properties
- Flexbox (CSS INTERNAL COMPONENT)

### What I learned

Finally i made it happen i am so exicted with this project also this was my first project where my main focus was towards bulding the things with responsive. it was fun implementing different stretergies making things. Finally i realised making things is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.
